            <h2>UK shoppers avoid High Streets amid Omicron fears</h2>
            <article>
                The number of people on High Streets fell by 5.9% on Sunday but rose 4.8% at retail parks week-on-week,
                retail analysis firm Springboard said.
                Springboard's Diane Wehrle, said consumers were "clearly cautious" about venturing out to the shops.
                Shoppers were also making quick "in and out" visits, another expert added.
                Business alarm at prospect of more Covid measures
                Firms plead for help as customers cancel bookings
                Can businesses survive another lost Christmas?
                Ms Wehrle said, in part, this was due to shoppers trying to get a head start in buying groceries, while
                The Springboard figures also showed that 25.2% fewer people visited UK retail destinations on Sunday,
                compared to 22 December 2019, the Sunday just before Christmas that year.
                However, visitor numbers across all UK destinations on Sunday were 33.2% higher than on Sunday 20
                December 2020, when the UK entered its third coronavirus lockdown.
                On Sunday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr that further Covid restrictions for
                England over Christmas could not be ruled out, due to the rise in new cases.<a href="">Read more</a>

                        <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appears to have pulled a financial rabbit out of the
                            hat to stop the lira's free fall. But that will not help him secure another presidential
                            term, writes Banu Güven. At the end of a long day, as the Turkish lira had plunged to
                            another record low against the euro and the US dollar, the Turkish president announced a
                            spate of measures to prop up the lira and guaranteed that the government would cover losses
                            by lira deposit holders in cases where the lira's depreciation against foreign currencies
                            exceeds banks' interest rates. </p>

                            Despite promises to the contrary, the Taliban are unlikely to oppose cultivation of the
                            narcotic cash crop.The cultivation of opium poppy as a medicinal plant has a long history in
                            Afghanistan.
                            The milky sap extracted from the seed pods is dried to produce raw opium, an effective
                            remedy for severe pain. Today, opium is used primarily as an intoxicant and as a raw
                            material for the production of stronger drugs like prescription painkillers and heroin.</p>

                            the iconic leader and El Salvador. Nayib Bukele did it again. When the news of the newly
                            emerging omicron coronavirus variant was spreading around the world in early December,
                            sending riskier financial assets like stocks, junk bonds, and not least of all
                            cryptocurrencies in a tailspin, the Salvadoran president bought the dips.
