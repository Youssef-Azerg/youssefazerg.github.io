            <h2>Ukraine tensions: Biden and Putin phone call seeks 'diplomatic path'</h2>
            <article>
                US President Joe Biden is set to hold talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin for the second time this month,
                in a bid to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine.
                The two leaders will speak by phone on Thursday.
                They will discuss forthcoming security talks between the countries and the situation in Europe, a White
                House official said.
                Russia, which recently built up forces on the border with Ukraine, denies planning to invade the
                country.
                It says its troops are there for exercises, and that it is entitled to move its troops freely on its own
                soil.
                Hours before the call, Mr Putin told Mr Biden in a holiday message he was "convinced" the pair could
                work together based on "mutual respect and consideration of each other's national interests".
                His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow was "in the mood for a conversation".
                A day earlier, a US official told AFP news agency that Mr Biden would offer his Russian counterpart a
                "diplomatic path" but remained "gravely" concerned by the Russian troop build-up on the border.
                The head of Ukraine's national security council, Oleksiy Danilov, sought to downplay that on Thursday,
                saying: "As for the troops build-up near our borders reported by foreign media - we do not see that.
                There is a certain increase of [Russian] military and we closely monitor what's happening at our
                borders."
                Less than a month ago, Ukraine's defence minister told parliament - citing intelligence reports - that
                Russia had massed more than 94,000 troops near the border and could be gearing up for a large-scale
                military offensive at the end of January. ...<a href="">Read more</a>

                    at a zoo in Florida.
                    Eko, an eight-year-old Malayan tiger, was found with the man's arm in its mouth at Naples Zoo.
                    The sheriff's deputy tried to get the animal to let go of the arm but was "forced to shoot",
                    officials say. <a href="">Read more</a> </p>

                <p class="card-text">Afghanistan's former president has defended his decision to flee the country as the
                    Taliban closed in earlier this year, saying he did it to prevent the destruction of Kabul.
                    The Taliban seized power in August after taking control of the capital.
                    Ashraf Ghani revealed that when he woke up on 15 August he had "no inkling" it would be his last day
                    in Afghanistan.
                    It was only when his plane left Kabul that he realised he was going, Mr Ghani said on BBC Radio 4's

                <p class="card-text">Elon Musk has rejected claims that his Starlink satellite internet project is
                    taking up too much room in space.
                    "Tens of billions" of satellites can be accommodated in orbits close to Earth, he told the Financial
                    Times.
                    His comments come after a claim by the head of the European Space Agency (ESA) that Mr Musk was
                    "making the rules" for the emerging commercial space industry.
                    This week, China complained that its space station was forced to avoid collisions with Starlink

                    Marisa Fotieo says she felt her throat hurt while travelling from Chicago to Reykjavik, in Iceland,
                    on 20 December.
                    Ms Fotieo says she performed a rapid test with a kit she had brought with her, which confirmed she
                    was infected.
                    She remained in the toilet for the rest of the trip, and a flight attendant provided food and drinks
                    to her.
                    It was not immediately clear whether she had had to present a Covid-19 test before boarding the

                <p class="card-text">Many were angry about what they saw as the indifference of the Royal Family towards
                    the princess, after she had divorced Prince Charles and relinquished her HRH royal title.
                    At the time, Dean Carr - who took part in negotiations over the service between the palace and
                    Princess Diana's family - said being involved in her funeral was the biggest thing he had ever done.
                    He saw it as a "rare opportunity for the abbey to bring together pageantry, history and the common
                    touch".
                    The files show he saw Sir Elton as an essential part of that combination.
                    The abbey had arranged for a young saxophonist to be on standby to deliver a poignant solo, although
                    the dean described this as "a very second-best shot".<a href="">Read more</a>

                <p class="card-text">The BBC says an interview with lawyer Alan Dershowitz after the conviction of
                    Ghislaine Maxwell did not meet its editorial standards.
                    Maxwell was found guilty of recruiting and trafficking young girls to be sexually abused by late US
                    financier Jeffrey Epstein.
                    Mr Dershowitz used to be a lawyer for Epstein and has himself been accused of sexual abuse by one of
                    the accusers.
                    He denies the accusation. But the BBC said he was not "an impartial analyst".<a href="">Readmore</a>
